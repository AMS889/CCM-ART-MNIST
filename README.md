## Information on human similarity ratings
 - Use this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1obAhn-Prz5hTcl1Pk-rlfMEkpzFqZy0LJn4D1Tp4KJs/edit?usp=sharing "Empty Google Sheets Rating Template") to access the Google Sheets rating template.
 - Use the image files [here](./files_for_comparison/) to access the 30 randomly generated digit pairs for each digit. The naming convention is as follows: "digit_comparisonX.png" where X represents a digit from 0 to 9. For example [digit_comparison0.png](./files_for_comparison/digit_comparison0.png) is an image file with all 30 pairs of zeros.
 - Once you have rated the similarity of all 30 pairs on a 1 (not similar at all) to 10 (very similar) scale you can download the Google Sheets document as a .csv file and either post it to [here](./human_ratings/) or email it to one of us.
